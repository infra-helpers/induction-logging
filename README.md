# Overview
[That repository](https://github.com/infra-helpers/induction-logging) aims
at providing end-to-end examples introducing how to collect, store
and query logs, produced by different frameworks relevant to data science
(_e.g._, Python, Scala), for local as well as cloud-operated applications.
